# Lightning Network Payments

ngx_l402 implements the [L402 protocol](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402), enabling API monetization via **Lightning Network payments**. When a client hits a protected endpoint without a valid token, the module responds with `402 Payment Required` and a Lightning invoice. The client pays the invoice, receives a preimage, and presents it alongside the macaroon to gain access.

## Supported Backends

Configure the backend via the `LN_CLIENT_TYPE` environment variable:

| `LN_CLIENT_TYPE` | Description |
|---|---|
| `LND` | Lightning Network Daemon — direct gRPC connection |
| `LNC` | Lightning Node Connect — remote LND via mailbox (no open port needed) |
| `CLN` | Core Lightning |
| `ECLAIR` | Eclair node |
| `LNURL` | Lightning Network URL — delegate invoice generation to an LNURL server |
| `NWC` | Nostr Wallet Connect |
| `BOLT12` | Reusable Lightning Offers (BOLT12) |

See [Environment Variables](./config-env-vars.md) for the full list of per-backend settings.

## Payment Flow

1. Client requests a protected endpoint (no auth header).
2. Module generates a macaroon and requests an invoice from the configured Lightning backend.
3. Module responds `402 Payment Required` with:
   ```
   WWW-Authenticate: L402 macaroon="<macaroon>", invoice="<bolt11>"
   ```
4. Client pays the invoice and obtains the **preimage**.
5. Client retries with:
   ```
   Authorization: L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>
   ```
6. Module verifies the macaroon + preimage and returns `200 OK`.

## Authorization Header Format

Two formats are accepted:

| Format | Header value | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | `L402 <macaroon>:<preimage_hex>` | Client has the preimage (standard wallet flow) |
| **Auto-detect** | `L402 <macaroon>` | Server queries the node; no preimage needed from client |

> The preimage in the classic format must be the **32-byte (256-bit) hex-encoded payment preimage** corresponding to the invoice's `payment_hash`.

---

## Auto-Detect Payment (Server-Side Settlement Lookup)

With **auto-detect** enabled the client only needs to send the macaroon — no preimage required. The module queries your Lightning node directly to check whether the invoice is settled and retrieves the preimage from the node.

### Enabling auto-detect

Add `l402_auto_detect_payment on` to any `location {}` block:

```nginx
location /protected {
    l402                         on;
    l402_amount_msat_default     10000;
    l402_macaroon_timeout        0;
    l402_auto_detect_payment     on;   # ← enables server-side lookup
}
```

All boolean directives (`l402`, `l402_auto_detect_payment`) accept: `on` / `off` / `true` / `false` / `1` / `0` / `yes` / `no` (case-insensitive).

### Client flow with auto-detect enabled

1. Client requests a protected endpoint → receives `402 Payment Required` with a BOLT-11 invoice.
2. Client pays the invoice (no preimage handling needed).
3. Client retries with just the macaroon:
   ```
   Authorization: L402 <macaroon>
   ```
4. Module extracts the `payment_hash` from the macaroon identifier, queries the node, and — if the invoice is settled — uses the returned preimage to verify the macaroon signature.
5. On success the module returns `200 OK`. If the invoice is not yet settled, it returns `402 Payment Required`.

### Preimage caching (Redis)

When Redis is configured (`REDIS_URL`), settled preimages are cached under the key `l402:settled:<payment_hash_hex>`. Subsequent requests for the same payment hash are served from the cache, avoiding repeated node round-trips.

### Backend support matrix

| `LN_CLIENT_TYPE` | Auto-detect supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LND` | ✅ | Uses `LookupInvoice` gRPC |
| `CLN` / `BOLT12` | ✅ | Uses `listinvoices` JSON-RPC over unix socket |
| `ECLAIR` | ✅ | Uses `POST /getreceivedinfo` REST API |
| `NWC` | ⚠️ | Uses NIP-47 `lookup_invoice`, which wallets may not implement |
| `LNC` | ❌ | LNC mailbox does not expose `LookupInvoice` |
| `LNURL` | ❌ | Remote wallet — no server-side query API |

> [!NOTE]
> Even when `l402_auto_detect_payment on` is set, the classic `L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>` format is still accepted — auto-detect only activates when the client omits the preimage.

## Wallet Compatibility

> [!WARNING]
> Some wallets (e.g. [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/)) return **48-byte non-standard preimages**, which are **not compatible** with this module. Use a wallet that returns a standard 32-byte preimage.

## Also Supported: Cashu eCash

In addition to Lightning, the module accepts **Cashu eCash tokens** via the `X-Cashu` header as an alternative payment method. See [Cashu eCash Support](./cashu.md) for details.
